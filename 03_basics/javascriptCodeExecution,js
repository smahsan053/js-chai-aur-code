Global Execution Context
Function Execution Context

Memory creation phase (or called creation phase) : in this phase only memory is allocated to the variables functions
Execution phase : Code is executed in this ohase
               For every time the code is execute, a context is created, which consist of : 
		New Variable Enviorment
                Execution Thread
	 It returns the variable to the parent context, ie. global execution context, and then it is delete to free up the memory
